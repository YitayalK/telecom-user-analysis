# Telecom Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and analysis for exploring and deriving insights from a telecom dataset. The project aims to improve user engagement, experience, and satisfaction by analyzing network performance, customer behavior, and clustering techniques. The findings are designed to help telecom operators optimize their services and customer interactions.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:
1. **User Engagement Analysis**  
   Understand customer interaction with telecom services using metrics like session frequency, session duration, and total traffic.

2. **Experience Analytics**  
   Evaluate network performance (TCP retransmissions, RTT, and throughput) and device characteristics to assess user experience.

3. **Satisfaction Analysis**  
   Combine engagement and experience metrics to assign satisfaction scores and predict customer satisfaction levels.

4. **Team Leadership Simulation**  
   Provide leadership strategies for managing a lagging team and optimizing their performance.

## Tasks

### **Task 1: Data Preparation**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and transform raw data into meaningful metrics.

### **Task 2: User Engagement Analysis**
- Aggregate session frequency, session duration, and total traffic per user.  
- Perform K-means clustering to classify users into engagement groups and visualize findings.  
- Identify top users by application and analyze app usage trends.

### **Task 3: Experience Analytics**
- Compute average TCP retransmissions, RTT, throughput, and analyze per handset type.  
- Cluster users based on network parameters to identify experience groups.  
- Visualize distributions and interpret findings.

### **Task 4: Satisfaction Analysis**
- Assign engagement and experience scores using Euclidean distance.  
- Calculate satisfaction scores and predict satisfaction using a regression model.  
- Group users into satisfaction clusters and export results to a MySQL database.
